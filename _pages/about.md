I’m Jaswanth Reddy, a BTech graduate from [IIT Tirupati](https://www.iittp.ac.in/), specializing in Computer Vision and NLP. I worked as Research Intern in [VAL Labs (IISc)](https://val.cds.iisc.ac.in/), which is ranked 1st in Computer Vision in India according to [CSRankings 2024](https://csrankings.org/#/fromyear/2014/toyear/2024/index?ai&vision&mlmining&nlp&inforet&in). There, I contributed to cutting-edge projects focused on 3D reconstruction and manipulation using Neural Radiance Fields and Gaussian Splatting. After that, I worked with ViSAL Labs, where I developed a memory-based long and short-term tracking model for transformer-based architectures, specializing in single and multi-object tracking.

Currently, at [AutoAlign.ai](https://www.autoalign.ai/), my primary focus is on advancing NLP technologies. I’ve played a pivotal role in developing robust safety guardrails for large language models (LLMs) and led the creation of comprehensive datasets and pipelines for efficient training and testing.
